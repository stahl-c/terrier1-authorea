The debate whether evaluative conditioning (EC), with stimuli presented subliminally
  during the learning phase, is ongoing. This study investigates whether an EC effect
  can be found in a subconscious conditioned stimulus (CS) paradigm when the CS is
  relevant to a need state of the participant and the US and CS are relevant towards
  each other. Furthermore visibility of the short presented stimuli is checked online.
