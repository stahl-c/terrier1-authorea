## Sample

__Power Analysis:__

A sample of __??__ participants took part in this study. A sensitivity analysis revealed that an effect as small as __????__ can be found with this sample size with a power of 1 - beta = .95, classified by Cohen as a __??__ effect (BRON: Cohen). The design was a 2 (thirst manipulation: yes/no) x 4 (US: disgust faces/ disgust IAPS pictures/ Fear faces/ no US) x 2 (CS: relevant to thirst[water bottles]/ irrelevant to thirst [airplane logos] ) x 2 (presentation time CS: 30ms/ 1000ms). The first factor was manipulated between participants, all others within.


## Material

As CSs for the thirst relevant condition we used 8 water bottles, all with a different logo found in an online search. For the thirst irrelevant condition we used 8 pictures of airplane companies. The two sets resulted from a pilot study were a larger set of bottles and airplane company logo's had to be rated, and neutrally scoring pictures were selected. No selected picture was reported as known by more than 6.6 % of the participants (N = 31) from this pilot study.

Each CS was presented 5 times, either with 5 different US from a specific category or 5 times without a US.As US we used 5 pictures of faces looking disgusted and 5 pictures of faces looking fearful (Bron: RAFD). Those were the same US as in the study by Verwijmeren et al (BRON). The US that were supposed to only transfer the affect of disgust were selected from the IAPS collection(BRON: IAPS), based on disgust ratings around 1 SD above the average disgust ratings (BRON: Libkuman, 2007). 

A colored pixel mask was created, used as a premask in every trial, including the supraliminal trials. It was additionally used as a post-mask in the mere exposure trials.

## Procedure

__CS introduced to participants as water brands or airplaine companies?__
Participants were told that they would see a lot of pictures, some very shortly. It was their task to identify those, shortly presented pictures. There were no further instruction on how to react to all other pictures. They were however told, that it was a difficult task to identify those pictures and that they had to guess, when not sure.

One trial was constructed as follows: A colored, squared sized (400 x 400 pixel), pre mask in the middle of the screen announced every trial. It was shown for _???? ms_. Immediately afterwards a CS was shown, with the same size as the pre-mask. Depending on the condition it was shown for _???ms_ or for _1000ms?_. Without a gap in between the US was shown, also functioning as a postmask. The US had a size of 512 x 384 pixel. The US was shown for ___??ms__ in the short Cs presentation trial and for ___??ms__ in the longer CS presentation trial, resulting in a total trial duration of _??ms_ for each trial. Afterwards the screen was cleared. 

After trials with a short CS presentation a screen appeared showing all 8 objects (either water bottles or plane logo's depending on the condition in the trial). Participants had to select an object by pressing a corresponding number to report which object they thought to have seen in the previous trial. The order of object presentation was randomized for each trial.

Since we decided not to have an online visibility check for trials in which the CS was shown for 1000ms we included 5 trials with a new bottle and 5 trials with a new airplane logo followed by a neutral US for slightly longer than the subconscious CS, namely for __????ms__. This was in order to keep the motivation to detect a shortly presented CS high (BRON: Pratte and Rouder) since it was easier to detect the CS in these cases. These trials were not included in the measure of the depending variable, since no hypothesis existed about these trials. We only looked at the rate of correct detection, since it should have been rather easy in this case. __Participants showing a ???? deviation from the mean correct detection rate were excluded in the analysis.__ [What do you think?, just a first idea]

This setup resulted in a total of 90 trials that were part of this learning phase. Since the same US were used for subliminal and supraliminal CS presentation trials, the CS category were assigned at random for each participant individually to a fixed pair of presentation time and US type. 

After the learning phase evaluative ratings and choices were collected. The order in which  the two depended variables were collected were counterbalanced over participants. In the rating measurement, each critical water bottle and each airplane logo were shown separately and asked to be rated on a 9 point likert scale. Water bottle ratings were always asked first and afterwards the ratings of the airplane logo's.

In the choice measure participants were instructed to choose a bottle, based on which they would like to drink. All 8 bottles were shown on a screen with corresponding number underneath. After one number was chosen for the selected bottle the resulting 7 bottles were shown and a new decision was asked for. This process was repeated until 7 decisions had been made, while the order of stimuli was at random for every new presentation.
The same procedure was repeated with the airplane logo's.

In the end the following demographic items and debriefing questions were asked: age, study, gender, overall idea of goal of study, reason for thirst manipulation (if in the condition), further comments (__anything else?__).
