	abstract = {The authors explored three properties of basic, unconsciously triggered affective reactions: They can influence consequential behavior, they work without eliciting conscious feelings, and they interact with motivation. The authors investigated these properties by testing the influence of subliminally presented happy versus angry faces on pouring and consumption of beverage (Study 1), perception of beverage value (Study 2), and reports of conscious feelings (both studies). Consistent with incentive motivation theory, the impact of affective primes on beverage value and consumption was strongest for thirsty participants. Subliminal smiles caused thirsty participants to pour and consume more beverage (Study 1) and increased their willingness to pay and their wanting more beverage (Study 2). Subliminal frowns had the opposite effect. No feeling changes were observed, even in thirsty participants. The results suggest that basic affective reactions can be unconscious and interact with incentive motivation to influence assessment of value and behavior toward valenced objects.},

	shorttitle = {Automatic affective priming of recently acquired stimulus valence},
	abstract = {In a recent series of studies, it was demonstrated that originally neutral stimuli that were predictive of an electrocutaneous stimulus in a differential aversive conditioning procedure not only acquired “signal-value” but also acquired a negative affective valence. These affective changes were not only evident from the evaluative ratings scales, but also from the data of an affective priming procedure. This response-latency based priming procedure has recently been employed as an indirect and unobtrusive index of stimulus valence (attitudes) (e.g., Fazio, Jackson, Dunton, \& Williams, 1995). In the present experiment, the use of the affective priming procedure as an indirect measure of stimulus valence was further explored. Results showed that aversively conditioned stimuli revealed their newly acquired valence in this priming procedure. As predicted, this effect was obtained at the short {SOA} (300 ms) but not at the long {SOA} (1000 ms). The significant {SOA} X Priming interaction suggests that the affective priming procedure is less or not affected by demand effects and (self-presentational) response strategies. This makes the affective priming effect and excellent and unobtrusive measure of affective valence and an interesting alternative to subjective rating scales in situations where demand effects might otherwise influence responding. The results are also related to recent research on conditioning models of the acquisition of anxiety disorders, and to research on the co-occurrence of expectancy learning and affective learning within these models.},

On the basis of recent insights about unconscious influences on information processing, we tested whether automatic mental associations of undecided individuals bias future choices in a manner such that these choices reflect the evaluations implied by earlier automatic associations. With the use of a computer-based, speeded categorization task to assess automatic mental associations (i.e., associations that are activated unintentionally, difficult to control, and not necessarily endorsed at a conscious level) and self-report measures to assess consciously endorsed beliefs and choice preferences, automatic associations of undecided participants predicted changes in consciously reported beliefs and future choices over a period of 1 week. Conversely, for decided participants, consciously reported beliefs predicted changes in automatic associations and future choices over the same period. These results indicate that decision-makers sometimes have already made up their mind at an unconscious level, even when they consciously indicate that they are still undecided.},

The present article provides an integrative review of the available evidence on implicit and explicit attitude change that is guided by a distinction between associative and propositional processes. Whereas associative processes are characterized by mere activation independent of subjective truth or falsity, propositional reasoning is concerned with the validation of evaluations and beliefs. The proposed associative-propositional evaluation ({APE}) model makes specific assumptions about the mutual interplay of the 2 processes, implying several mechanisms that lead to symmetric or asymmetric changes in implicit and explicit attitudes. The model integrates a broad range of empirical evidence and implies several new predictions for implicit and explicit attitude change.},

Subsequent likability ratings revealed that the mere co-occurrence of a product with the valenced face influenced the evaluation of the previously neutral targets. However, this effect of affective learning was significantly stronger in the sad-mood condition.

	abstract = {Phenomena that vary over time can often be represented as a complex waveform. Fourier analysis decomposes this complex wave into a set of sinusoidal component waves. In some phenomena, the amplitude of these waves varies in inverse relation to frequency. This pattern has been called 1/f noise and, unlike white noise, it reflects nonrandom variation. Latencies in simple computer tasks typically reveal 1/f noise, but the magnitude of the noise decreases as tasks become more challenging. The current work hypothesizes a correspondence between 1/f noise and effort, leading to the prediction that increasing effort will reduce 1/f noise. In 2 studies, the author examined the relationship between an individual's attempts to avoid bias (measured in Study 1, manipulated in Study 2) and 1/f noise in implicit measures of stereotyping and prejudice. In each study, participants who made an effort to modulate the use of racial information showed less 1/f noise than did participants who made less effort. The potential value of this analytic approach to social psychology is discussed., (C) 2008 by the American Psychological Association},

	abstract = {Subliminal priming is said to occur when a subliminal prime influences the classification of a subsequent target. Most subliminal-priming claims are based on separate target- and prime-classification tasks. Because primes are intended to be subliminal, the prime-classification task is difficult, and the target-classification task is easy. To assess whether this task-difficulty difference accounts for previous claims of subliminal priming, we manipulated the ease of the prime-classification task by intermixing long-duration (visible) primes with short-duration (near liminal) ones. In Experiment 1, this strategy of intermixing long-duration primes raised classification of the shortduration ones. In Experiments 2 and 3, prime duration was lowered in such a way that prime classification was at chance in intermixed presentations. Under these conditions, we failed to observe any priming effects; hence, previous demonstrations of subliminal priming may simply have reflected a task-difficulty artifact.},

	abstract = {Stronger affective priming (Murphy \& Zajonc, 1993) with suboptimal (i.e., reduced consciousness) than with optimal (i.e., full consciousness) prime presentation suggests that nonconscious processes form an important part of emotions. Merikle and Joordens (1997) have argued that both impoverished presentation and divided attention can produce suboptimal conditions and result in parallel effects. We manipulated attention by means of a concurrent working memory load while keeping presentation duration constant, as participants evaluated Japanese ideographs that were preceded by happy, neutral, or angry faces (affective priming) and male or female faces (nonaffective priming). In contrast to nonaffective priming, affective priming was larger with divided attention than with focused attention. It is concluded that manipulations of stimulus quality and of attention can both be used to probe the distinction between conscious and nonconscious processes and that the highest chances of obtaining the pattern of stronger priming with suboptimal presentation than with optimal presentation occur in the affective domain.},

	abstract = {When a person can be described by both a positive and a negative trait, a perceiver's mood may influence which trait category is accessed for subsequent inferences about the person's behavior. A positive mood should prime the positive trait category and activate knowledge associated with it. As a result, the person should be perceived as more likely to engage in behaviors implied by the positive trait category. Similar predictions can be made about the effects of negative mood. Two studies tested these hypotheses. In Study 1, positive, neutral, or negative moods were induced through exposure to brief stories with happy, neutral, or sad content. Then, in an allegedly unrelated experiment, subjects read about four stimulus persons, each described by a positive and a negative trait category (e.g., moody and warm), and rated the likelihood that the targets would engage in behaviors applicable to the positive trait, behaviors applicable to the negative trait, and behaviors that were simply positive and negative but not applicable to either trait. Positive mood increased the likelihood estimates of behaviors applicable to the positive trait category, while negative moods increased the likelihood estimates of behaviors applicable to the negative trait category. The likelihood estimates for behavior nonapplicable to either trait category were unaffected by subjects' mood. Study 2, using a facial feedback technique and using somewhat richer stimuli, replicated the findings of Study 1 for negative mood and suggests that the effect is mediated by moods increasing the accessibility of mood congruent trait categories. The implications of the results for research on category accessibility and on moods are discussed.},

	abstract = {Visual detection and discrimination thresholds are often measured using adaptive staircases, and most studies use transformed (or weighted) up/down methods with fixed step sizes—in the spirit of Wetherill and Levitt (Br J Mathemat Statist Psychol 1965;18:1–10) or Kaernbach (Percept Psychophys 1991;49:227–229)—instead of changing step size at each trial in accordance with best-placement rules—in the spirit of Watson and Pelli (Percept Psychophys 1983;47:87–91). It is generally assumed that a fixed-step-size ({FSS}) staircase converges on the stimulus level at which a correct response occurs with the probabilities derived by Wetherill and Levitt or Kaernbach, but this has never been proved rigorously. This work used simulation techniques to determine the asymptotic and small-sample convergence of {FSS} staircases as a function of such parameters as the up/down rule, the size of the steps up or down, the starting stimulus level, or the spread of the psychometric function. The results showed that the asymptotic convergence of {FSS} staircases depends much more on the sizes of the steps than it does on the up/down rule. Yet, if the size Δ+ of a step up differs from the size Δ− of a step down in a way that the ratio Δ−/Δ+ is constant at a specific value that changes with up/down rule, then convergence percent-correct is unaffected by the absolute sizes of the steps. For use with the popular one-, two-, three- and four-down/one-up rules, these ratios must respectively be set at 0.2845, 0.5488, 0.7393 and 0.8415, rendering staircases that converge on the 77.85\%-, 80.35\%-, 83.15\%- and 85.84\%-correct points. Wetherill and Levitt's transformed up/down rules—which require Δ−/Δ+=1—and the general version of Kaernbach's weighted up/down rule—which allows any Δ−/Δ+ ratio—fail to reach their presumed targets. The small-sample study showed that, even with the optimal settings, short {FSS} staircases (up to 20 reversals in length) are subject to some bias, and their precision is less than reasonable, but their characteristics improve when the size Δ+ of a step up is larger than half the spread of the psychometric function. Practical recommendations are given for the design of efficient and trustworthy {FSS} staircases.},

Often keyboards are employed to collect buttonpresses, but their imprecision and variability decreases test power and increases the risk of false positives. Response boxes and data acquisition cards are precise, but expensive and inflexible, alternatives. We propose using open-source Arduino microcontroller boards as an inexpensive and flexible alternative. These boards connect to standard experimental software using a {USB} connection and a virtual serial port, or by emulating a keyboard. In our solution, an Arduino measures response latencies after being signaled the start of a trial, and communicates the latency and response back to the {PC} over a {USB} connection. We demonstrated the reliability, robustness, and precision of this communication in six studies. Test measures confirmed that the error added to the measurement had an {SD} of less than 1 ms. Alternatively, emulation of a keyboard results in similarly precise measurement. The Arduino performs as well as a serial response box, and better than a keyboard. In addition, our setup allows for the flexible integration of other sensors, and even actuators, to extend the cognitive science toolbox.},

The review covers autonomic conditioning, conditioning with subliminal stimuli, eyeblink conditioning, conditioning in amnesia, evaluative conditioning, and conditioning under anesthesia. The bulk of the evidence is consistent with the position that awareness is necessary but not sufficient for conditioned performance, although studies suggestive of conditioning without awareness are identified as worthy of further investigation. Many studies have used inadequate measures of awareness, and strategies for increasing validity and sensitivity are discussed. It is concluded that conditioning may depend on the operation of a propositional system associated with consciousness rather than a separate, lower level system.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the present investigation was to replicate and extend the International Affective Picture System norms (Ito, Cacioppo, \& Lang, 1998; Lang, Bradley, \& Cuthbert, 1999). These norms were developed to provide researchers with photographic slides that varied in emotional evocation, especially arousal and valence. In addition to collecting rating data on the dimensions of arousal and valence, we collected data on the dimensions of consequentiality, meaningfulness, familiarity, distinctiveness, and memorability. Furthermore, we collected ratings on the primary emotions of happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear. A total of 1,302 participants were tested in small groups. The participants in each group rated a subset of 18 slides on 14 dimensions. Ratings were obtained on 703 slides. The means and standard deviations for all of the ratings are provided. We found our valence ratings to be similar to the previous norms. In contrast, our participants were more likely to rate the slides as less arousing than in the previous norms. The mean ratings on the remaining 12 dimensions were all below the midpoint of the 9-point Likert scale. However, sufficient variability in ratings across the slides indicates that selecting slides on the basis of these variables is feasible. Overall, the present ratings should allow investigators to use these norms for research purposes, especially in research dealing with the interrelationships among emotion and cognition. The means and standard deviations for emotions may be downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet from www.psychonomic.org/archive.},

In previous experiments attention has typically been manipulated in a general way rather than looking at the particular focus of attention. The present study investigated the role of a focus on the {CS}–{US} contingency. Two separate distraction tasks were designed that either diverted attention from the stimuli or directed it to the stimuli while drawing attention away from the contingency between the stimuli. Both types of distraction were shown to eliminate evaluative conditioning. Significant evaluative conditioning was observed in a third group of participants who were required to attend the contingencies. A mediation analysis showed that the observed discrepancy in evaluative conditioning effects between groups was mediated by contingency awareness. The results imply that attention in terms of a stimulus focus is not sufficient for evaluative conditioning to occur. Rather, attention to the contingencies between stimuli appears to be crucial in evaluative conditioning, because it is supposed to foster the acquisition of contingency awareness.},

	abstract = {Evaluative conditioning ({EC}) refers to the change in the valence of a conditioned stimulus ({CS}) due to its pairing with a positive or negative unconditioned stimulus ({US}). To the extent that core affect can be characterised by the two dimensions of valence and arousal, {EC} has important implications for the origin of affective responses. However, the distinction between valence and arousal is rarely considered in research on {EC} or conditioned responses more generally. Measuring the subjective feelings elicited by a {CS}, the results from two experiments showed that (1) repeated pairings of a {CS} with a positive or negative {US} of either high or low arousal led to corresponding changes in both {CS} valence and {CS} arousal, (2) changes in {CS} arousal, but not changes in {CS} valence, were significantly related to recollective memory for {CS}-{US} pairings, (3) subsequent presentations of the {CS} without the {US} reduced the conditioned valence of the {CS}, with conditioned arousal being less susceptible to extinction and (4) {EC} effects were stronger for high arousal than low arousal {USs}. The results indicate that the conditioning of affective responses can occur simultaneously along two independent dimensions, supporting evidence in related areas that calls for a consideration of both valence and arousal. Implications for research on {EC} and the acquisition of emotional dispositions are discussed.},

The theory is applicable to decision making, impression formation, attitude formation and change, problem solving, and creativity. It distinguishes between two modes of thought: unconscious and conscious. Unconscious thought and conscious thought have different characteristics, and these different characteristics make each mode preferable under different circumstances. For instance, contrary to popular belief, decisions about simple issues can be better tackled by conscious thought, whereas decisions about complex matters can be better approached with unconscious thought. The relations between the theory and decision strategies, and between the theory and intuition, are discussed. We end by discussing caveats and future directions.},

	abstract = {Affective priming studies have demonstrated that subliminally presented prime words can exert an influence on responses towards positive or negative target stimuli. In the present series of experiments, it was investigated whether these findings can be extended to pictorial stimuli. Ideographically selected positive, neutral, and negative picture primes that were sandwich-masked immediately preceded positive or negative target pictures (Experiment 1) or words (Experiments 2 \& 3). Evaluative categorization responses to these target stimuli were significantly influenced by the valence of the prime. First, it was demonstrated that high anxious participants were selectively slowed when the subliminally presented prime was negative (Experiments 1 \& 2). Second, the affective congruence between primes and targets also exerted an influence on the responses, but in a direction that is opposite to what is typically observed in affective priming research. These reverse priming effects are situated within a series of recent similar findings, and implications for theories of affective priming are discussed., (C) 2003 by the American Psychological Association},
